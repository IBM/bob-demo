# Generate Beads Integration Rule

This prompt asks Bob to create a rule file that teaches it how to use Beads for issue tracking.

## The Prompt

```
I've set up Beads issue tracking in this project using `bd init --stealth`. 

Please create a rule file at .bob/rules/beads-project.md that teaches you how to use Beads for issue tracking. The rule should document the essential Beads CLI commands and provide guidelines for AI agents on integrating Beads into the development workflow.

You can reference the Beads guidelines in the .beads/ directory for additional context.
```

## Example Output

See [optional-generated-content/beads-project.md](../optional-generated-content/beads-project.md) for the generated rule file.
