## How to Use This Template

1. Copy the entire "Template Demo" folder
2. Rename it to describe your specific demo (e.g., "React Component Migration Demo")
3. Populate each folder with your demo-specific content
4. Update this README.md to describe your specific demo
5. Add your demo to the main repository README.md

## Demo Guidelines
