# Implementation Journey Overview

This folder documents the step-by-step journey of working with IBM Bob on this demo.

## Purpose

The implementation journey helps others:
- Understand the workflow and decision-making process
- Learn from both successes and challenges
- See how Bob iteratively refines solutions
- Reproduce similar results in their own projects

## What to Include
