## 🎯 Repository Purpose

This repository showcases practical demonstrations of IBM Bob's capabilities across various use cases. Each demo is self-contained, well-documented, and designed to help you understand how to effectively work with Bob on real-world tasks.

Whether you're new to IBM Bob or looking to explore advanced features, these demos provide hands-on examples you can learn from and adapt to your own projects.

## 🤖 List of Demos

We recommend you to create a branch before starting using Bob with this repository, so in case of an error, ro to repeat the demo, you can always get back to the `main` branch.
