# Function Calling Implementation

**Mode:** Quarkus Developer

**Context:**

Asks Bob to create a function calling for the search booking database interaction.

**Prompt:**

```
Expose the getBookingDetail method from BookingService as a Tool
```

**Result:**

Bob cannot access the repository code to search bookings.
Also, registers the Tool to the AI Service created previously.

Last, modify the LLM prompt to indicate that it can use a tool to find book details.
