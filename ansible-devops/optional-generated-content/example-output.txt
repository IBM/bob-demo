# Example Output File

This is a placeholder file to demonstrate the Bob Generated Output folder structure.

Replace this with actual files generated by Bob during your demo, such as:
- Modified or created code files
- Generated documentation
- Test files
- Configuration files

## Example Content

```javascript
// Example: Modernized code generated by Bob
const calculateTotal = (items) => {
    return items.reduce((total, item) => total + item.price, 0);
};

// Bob's improvements:
// - Converted to arrow function
// - Used const instead of var
// - Replaced for loop with reduce for cleaner functional approach
// - More concise and readable
```

This example shows how Bob might modernize the legacy JavaScript from the input file.
